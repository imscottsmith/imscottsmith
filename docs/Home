<h1 style="margin: 0;">Hi, I'm Scott Smith</h1>
I'm currently the Co-Founder and of [Fizz](https://www.joinfizz.com), making financial tools that help young adults wield agency. Our first product was a debit card that builds credit. I previously studied at Y-Combinator (s21), and Cornell's Hotel School. I've been an active venture scout since my sophomore year at Cornell, and am a semi-active angel investor.

I'm based in San Francisco. 
I grew up in Michigan, and have lived in Cambridge (Massachusetts), Ann Arbor, Ithaca, New York City, and Berlin.
